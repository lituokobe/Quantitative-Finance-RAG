# Par Value of Stocks and Bonds Explained

## What Is Par Value?

Par value is the stated or [face value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp) of a financial instrument, primarily bonds and stocks. The par value is typically required at the time it is issued. For bonds and other fixed-income assets, it shows the maturity value and the dollar value of the coupon (or interest) payments that are due to the bondholder. Also called nominal or original value, par value is the opposite of market value, which fluctuates every day.

### Key Takeaways

- Par value is the face value of a bond or the value of a stock certificate, as stated in the corporate charter.
- The face value of the stock stated in the corporate charter is often unrelated to the actual value of its shares trading on the open market.
- Par value is imperative for a bond or a fixed-income instrument because it defines its maturity value and the dollar value of coupon payments.

## Understanding Par Value

Par value is the face value of certain assets, such as a bond. It determines the instrument's maturity value as well as the dollar value of coupon payments. This is contrary to the asset's market price, which may be above or below par depending on factors like the level of interest rates and its credit status. The most common par value for a bond is often \$1,000 but it isn't unusual to see bonds with par values of \$100.

A share's par value is stated in the corporate charter. Shares usually have no par value or low par value, such as one cent per share. Once defined, it is the lowest limit set to the value of a share of stock. The par value, however, is commonly unrelated to a stock's market price.

Par value is a primary component of fixed-income securities and represents the value of a contractual agreement between the issuing party and the bondholder. The issuer of a fixed-income security is liable to repay the lender the par value on the maturity date.

Companies issue shares of stock to raise equity, and those that issue par value stocks often do it at a value inconsistent with the actual market value. This adjustment allows companies to minimize their and the shareholders’ contractual obligations, as par value carries a binding contract between an organization and its shareholders.

### Fast Fact

The terms par value and face value are interchangeable and refer to the stated value of a financial instrument at the time it is issued.

## Par Value of Bonds

The par value of a bond is the amount of money the issuer promises to repay bondholders at maturity. Bondholders essentially loan money to the bond issuer.

Bonds can trade at a premium or a discount depending on the level of interest rates in the economy. A bond with a face value of \$1,000 trading at \$1,020 is trading at a premium, while another bond trading at \$950 is considered a discount bond. Whether a bond is trading at a discount or premium, the issuer always repays the par value to the investor at maturity.

The coupon rate determines whether a bond will trade at, below, or above par value. The coupon rate is the interest payment made to bondholders, annually or semi-annually, as compensation for loaning the bond issuer money. When market interest rates are lower, bonds trade above par. When market interest rates are higher, bonds trade at a discount.

### Calculating Par Value

A stock's par value never fluctuates and is determined when shares are issued and formally stated on the stock certificate. A bond's par value is the face value of the bond plus coupon payments, annually or sem-annually, owed to the bondholders by the issuer of the debt.

A bond with a par value of \$1,000 and a coupon rate of 4% will have annual interest payments of \$40 or 4% x \$1,000.

- If a 4% coupon bond is issued when market interest rates are 4%, the bond is considered trading at par value since both market interest and coupon rates are equal.
- If market interest rates rise to 5%, the value of the bond drops, and the bond will trade below par because the bond is paying a lower interest rate to its bondholders compared to the higher interest rate of 5% of other bonds in the market.
- If market interest rates fall to 3%, the value of the bond will rise and trade above par since the 4% coupon rate is more attractive than 3%.

While the par value of a corporate bond is usually stated as either \$100 or \$1,000, municipal bonds typically have par values of \$5,000. Treasury Bills are sold at a discount to par in multiples of \$100.

## Par Value of Stocks

Some states, including Florida, require that companies set a par value below which shares cannot be sold. To comply with state regulations, most companies set a par value for their stocks to a minimal amount. The par value for shares of Apple ([AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl)) is \$0.00001, and the par value for Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)) stock is \$0.01.

Shares cannot be sold below this value upon initial public offering (IPO) to reassure investors that no one is receiving preferential price treatment.

Some states allow the issuance of stock with no par value. An investor can identify no-par stocks on stock certificates as they will have "no par value" printed on them. The par value of a company's stock can be found in the Shareholders' Equity section of the balance sheet.

## Reasons Companies Set Par Value

There are four main reasons why a company might set a par value. This list mainly considers equities Note that any given company may not experience the same requirements or considerations for having to set a par value.

1. Meeting legal requirements. Many jurisdictions have corporate laws that mandate the assignment of a par value to shares upon incorporation. This requirement ensures that companies have a minimum level of capital. In some states, companies have to set par value as part of issuing stock.
2. Offering creditor protection. By setting a floor on the equity capital, par value ensures that there is a base amount of capital that remains within the company. Though companies may not always mean to do this, this protects creditors by ensuring that not all of the company’s assets can be distributed as dividends.
3. Setting investor perception. Par value, though often set at a nominal amount, can positively influence investor perceptions. The existence of par value can signal to investors that the company is meeting formal and legal standards. If nothing else, this may enhance their confidence in the company’s financial management and stability.
4. Helping in accounting and financial reporting. Par value plays a role in accounting. By differentiating the nominal value of shares (par value) from any additional amounts paid by investors (additional paid-in capital), companies can provide a clearer and more detailed picture of their financial health. This distinction may help aid analysts and regulators.

## Par Value vs. Market Value

A financial instrument's par value is determined by the institution that issues it. Market value is the current price at which a bond or stock can be traded on the open market and constantly fluctuates as investors buy and sell bonds and shares of stock.

A bond can be purchased for more or less than its par value, depending on interest rates and market sentiment. Because shares of stocks are commonly issued with a par value near zero, the market value is often higher than the par value. Investors count on gains made by the changing value of a stock based on company performance and market sentiment.

The market value of a security, especially stocks, is also dependent on other factors, including:

- Supply and demand
- Economic conditions
- Prices
- Interest rates
- Exchange rates
- Investor sentiment

## Par Value and Accounting

Par value plays a role in accounting. The par value of shares issued by a company is recorded in the common stock account on the balance sheet. Any amount received above the par value is recorded in the additional paid-in capital (APIC) account. Therefore, there are accounting and reporting presentation implications for what the par value is.

For example, if shares with a par value of \$1 are sold for \$5 each, \$1 per share is recorded in the Common Stock account, and the remaining \$4 per share is recorded in APIC. This separation helps clearly distinguish between the nominal value of shares and the additional capital contributed by shareholders.

Issuing par value stock impacts the balance sheet's equity section presentation. Though the ultimate dollar amount isn't impacted, this distinction provides transparency about the source of equity capital. While par value does not directly influence dividend payments, it impacts the calculation of legal capital, ensuring that a minimum amount of retained earnings is preserved to meet creditor protection requirements. So, it is important from an accounting perspective that these two amounts are recorded differently and according to [generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp).

For stocks issued with no par value, the total proceeds are credited to the common stock account, simplifying the equity classification and eliminating the concept of legal capital associated with par value. There is some accounting simplicity with this method, though they may have hurdles that prevent them from being able to do so.

## What Is Par Value at Maturity?

Par value at maturity refers to the value that the bond issuer pays the bondholder when the bond comes due once it matures. So, if the par value is \$1,000 and the bond matures in one year, the bondholder receives that amount a year from the issue date from the company on the bond's maturity date.

## What Does No-Par Value Mean?

No-par value means that a company's stock does not have a set minimum price per share. This means that the stock's value is only determined by the market. Companies often issue no-par value stocks to avoid legal liability if the price drops below a certain level and to simplify their accounting process (they don't have to keep tracking the difference between the par and market value of the stock).

## Are Bonds Issued at Par Value?

Bonds are not necessarily issued at their par value. They could also be issued at a premium or a discount depending on the level of interest rates in the economy. A bond that is trading above par is said to be trading at a premium, while a bond trading below par is trading at a discount.

## What Is the Relationship Between Coupon Rate and Par Value?

The coupon rate, the periodic interest payments made to bondholders as compensation for loaning the issuer the money, and the market interest rates determine whether a bond will trade at, below, or above its par value. If the coupon rate equals the interest rate, the bond will trade at its par value. If interest rates rise, the price of a lower-coupon bond must decline to offer the same yield to investors, causing it to trade below its par value. If interest rates fall, then the price of a higher-coupon bond will rise and trade above its par value since its coupon rate is more attractive.

## Is a Stock or Bond Required to Have Par Value?

In some jurisdictions, a security issuance may be required to have a par value. This isn't always the case, but in some situations, a stock or bond can't be issued without one.

## The Bottom Line

Par value is the face value of a bond or the value of a stock certificate stated in the corporate charter. A stock's par value is often unrelated to the actual value of its shares trading on the stock market. Par value is required for a bond or a fixed-income instrument and defines its maturity value and the value of its required coupon payments.
