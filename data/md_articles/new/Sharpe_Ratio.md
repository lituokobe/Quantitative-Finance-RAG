# Sharpe Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples

### Key Takeaways

- Economist William F. Sharpe proposed the Sharpe ratio in 1966 after his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
- Investors use the Sharpe ratio to compare a fund's historical or projected returns relative to an investment benchmark with the historical or expected variability of such returns.
- Excess returns are those above an industry benchmark or the risk-free rate of return.

## What Is the Sharpe Ratio?

Economist William F. Sharpe developed the Sharpe ratio in 1966. It compares an investment's return with its risk. The ratio's numerator is the difference between realized, or expected, returns and a benchmark, such as the [risk-free rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freereturn.asp) or the performance of a particular investment category over time. Its denominator is the standard deviation of returns over the same period, a measure of volatility and risk.

## Formula and Calculation of the Sharpe Ratio

Economist [William F. Sharpe](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/william-f-sharpe.asp) proposed the Sharpe ratio in 1966 as an outgrowth of his work on the [capital asset pricing model (CAPM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp), calling it the reward-to-variability ratio. Sharpe won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on CAPM in 1990.

Sharpe Ratio = R p − R f σ p where: R p = return of portfolio R f = risk-free rate σ p = standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return \begin{aligned} &\textit{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &R_{p}=\text{return of portfolio}\\ &R_{f} = \text{risk-free rate}\\ &\sigma_p = \text{standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return}\\ \end{aligned} ​Sharpe Ratio=σp​Rp​−Rf​​where:Rp​=return of portfolioRf​=risk-free rateσp​=standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return​

[Standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) is derived from the variability of returns for a series of time intervals, adding up to the total performance sample under consideration.

The numerator's total return differential versus a benchmark (*Rp*- *Rf)*is calculated as the average of the return differentials in each of the incremental periods making up the total. For example, the numerator of a 10-year Sharpe ratio might be the average of 120 monthly return differentials for a fund versus an industry benchmark.

The Sharpe ratio's denominator in that example will be the standard deviation of those monthly returns, calculated as follows:

1. Take the return variance from the average return in each of the incremental periods, square it, and sum the squares from all of the incremental periods.
2. Divide the sum by the number of incremental periods.
3. Take the square root of the quotient.
