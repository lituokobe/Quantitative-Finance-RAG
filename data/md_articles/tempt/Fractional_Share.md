# How to Buy & Sell Fractional Shares: Definition and Examples

## What Is a Fractional Share?

Less than one full share of [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) is called a fractional share. Fractional shares can result from stock splits, dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), or other corporate actions. Typically, fractional shares aren't available from the stock market, and while they have value to investors, they are also difficult to sell. Fractional shares can be common with high-priced stocks like Amazon and Google, making equity investments more accessible.

### Key Takeaways

- Fractional shares are less than one full share and often result from stock splits, mergers, or dividend reinvestment plans.
- These shares are difficult to sell on the open market and require a brokerage firm for trading.
- Some brokers, like Interactive Brokers and Fidelity, offer fractional share trading, enabling investment in high-priced stocks.
- Fractional shares can be an option for investors wishing to invest in expensive stocks without purchasing a full share.
- Investors may receive cash instead of fractional shares in certain corporate actions, and this cash is usually taxable.

## How Fractional Shares Are Created and Managed

Fractional shares come about in a number of ways, including dividend reinvestment plans, stock splits, mergers, and acquisitions.

### Dividend Reinvestment Plans

[Dividend reinvestment plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp) (DRIP) often create fractional shares. A dividend reinvestment plan is a plan in which a dividend-offering corporation or brokerage firm allows investors to use dividend [payouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payout.asp) to purchase more of the same shares. As this amount "drips" back into [the purchase of more shares](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/directsharepurchase.asp), it is not limited to whole shares. Reinvesting capital gain distributions and dollar-cost averaging programs can also result in purchasing fractional shares.

### Stock Splits

[Stock splits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.asp) don't always result in an even number of shares. A 3-for-2 stock split would create three shares for every two shares an investor owns, so an investor with an odd number of shares would end up with a fractional share after the split. Three shares would become 4½, five would become 7½, and so on.

### Mergers and Acquisitions

[Mergers and acquisitions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) (M&As) may also create fractional shares since companies combine new common stock using a predetermined ratio. The ratio often results in fractional shares for shareholders.

Some brokerage firms will split whole shares intentionally so they can sell fractional shares to clients. This division of shares is most often the case with high-priced stocks like Amazon ([AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn)) or Alphabet, Google's parent company ([GOOGL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=googl)). Fractional shares often can be the only way individual investors can buy stock in such companies.

For example, a young investor with limited funds might have their heart set on buying stock in Amazon. Starting with $1,000 to invest, they [won't have enough to buy a full share of stock](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/smallest-number-shares-stock-buy/), so they might find a brokerage firm willing to sell a fractional share. They could invest half in one-third of an Amazon share and the rest in cheaper stocks to buy whole shares.

### Important

In the event of stocks splits, mergers, and acquisitions, shareholders sometimes are given the option of obtaining cash in lieu of the fractional shares. Any income received from this is subject to tax.

## How to Trade Fractional Shares Successfully

The only way to sell fractional shares is through a major brokerage firm, which can join them with other fractional shares until a whole share is attained. If the selling stock does not have a high demand in the marketplace, selling the fractional shares might take longer than hoped.

Not everyone wants to hold onto fractional shares, especially if they ended up with them for inadvertent reasons such as stock splits. An investor might have 225 shares of XYZ stock priced at $12 per share. After a 3-for-2 stock split, they would end up with 337½ shares priced at $8 per share. Strong demand for XYZ stock makes it easier to sell fractional shares through a brokerage. Alternatively, they could buy another half share through a brokerage to reach 338 shares.
