# What Is a Mean? Types and Formulas

## What Is a Mean?

A mean is the mathematical average of two or more numbers. It can be computed using the [arithmetic mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arithmeticmean.asp) method, which uses the sum of the numbers in the series, and the [geometric mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/geometricmean.asp) method, which is the average of a set of products.

### Key Takeaways

- The mean is the mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers.
- The arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are two types of means.
- The geometric mean is a little more complicated to calculate but it can give an investor a more accurate measurement of an investment's performance.

## Arithmetic Mean

The arithmetic mean is the simple average or sum of a series of numbers divided by the count of that series of numbers. For example, the arithmetic mean of the numbers 4 and 9 is found by adding 4 and 9 and then dividing by 2 (the quantity of numbers). The arithmetic mean in this example is 6.5.

**A = 4+9/2**

**Arithmetric Mean = 6.5**

$$
Arithmetic Mean = Sum of Items / Number of Items
$$

## Geometric Mean

The geometric mean uses a more complex formula. To calculate the geometric mean, multiply all values within a dataset. Then, take the root of the sum equal to the number of values within that dataset.

**To calculate the geometric mean of the values 4 and 9:**

- Multiply 4x9 = 36
- Take the square root of 36
- Geometric Mean = 6

$$
Geometric Mean= {[(1+Return1) x (1+Return2) x (1+Return3)...)]^(1/n)]} - 1
$$

## Calculating Returns

Examine the price of a stock over a 10-day period. Imagine an investor purchased one share of stock for $148.01.

Arithmetic Mean = ( 0.0045 ) + 0.0121 + 0.0726 + . . . + 0.0043 + ( 0.0049 ) + 0.0376 10 = 0.0067 = 0.67 % \begin{aligned}\text{Arithmetic Mean} &= \tiny{\frac{ (0.0045) + 0.0121 + 0.0726 + ... + 0.0043 + (0.0049) + 0.0376 }{ 10 } } \\&= 0.0067 \\&= 0.67\% \\\end{aligned} Arithmetic Mean​=10(0.0045)+0.0121+0.0726+...+0.0043+(0.0049)+0.0376​=0.0067=0.67%​

Geometric Mean = 0.9955 × 1.0121 × 1.0726 × . . . × 1.0043 × 0.9951 × 1.0376 10 − 1 = 0.0061 = 0.61 % \begin{aligned}\text{Geometric Mean} &= \tiny{\sqrt[10]{ 0.9955 \times 1.0121 \times 1.0726 \times ... \times 1.0043 \times 0.9951 \times 1.0376 } - 1} \\&= 0.0061 \\&= 0.61\% \\\end{aligned} Geometric Mean​=100.9955×1.0121×1.0726×...×1.0043×0.9951×1.0376​−1=0.0061=0.61%​

The *arithmetic mean* is 0.67%: the total of the returns divided by 10. However, the arithmetic mean of returns is only accurate when there is no volatility in the market.

When the arithmetic mean of 0.67% is applied to each stock price, the end value is $152.63. However, the stock traded for $157.32 on the last day. This means that the arithmetic mean of returns is understated.

The *geometric mean* factors in [compounding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp) and volatility. Because it is impossible to take the root of a negative value, add one to all the percentage returns so that the product total yields a positive number. Take the 10th root of this number and subtract from one to get the percentage figure. The geometric mean of returns for the investor in the final five days is 0.61%.

When each closing price is raised by the geometric average return of 0.61%, the answer is $157.32. The geometric mean is a more accurate reflection of the true return of a [portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp).

### Important

As a mathematical rule, the geometric mean will always be equal to or less than the arithmetic mean.

## Why Means Matter to Investors

The mean is a [statistical indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp) used to gauge performance over time. Specific to investing, the mean is used to understand the performance of a company’s stock price over days, months, or years. Within business and investing, the mean is used extensively to:

- Determine whether an equity trades above or below its average over a specified period.
- Compare the average rate of return for broad markets during prior recessions or inflationary periods to guide decision-making.
- See whether trading volume or the quantity of market orders aligns with market activity.
- Analyze the operational performance of a company. Some financial ratios like days sales outstanding require determining the average accounts receivable balance for the numerator.
- Quantify macroeconomic data like average unemployment over time to determine the general health of an economy.

## What Is a Harmonic Mean?

The [harmonic mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harmonicaverage.asp) is calculated by dividing the number of observations by the reciprocal (one over the value) of each number in the series. Harmonic means are often used in finance to average data in fractions, ratios, or percentages, such as yields, returns, or price multiples.

## What Is the Difference Between Mean, Median, and Mode?

The mean is the average that appears in a set of data. The median is the midway point above (below) where 50% of the values in the data occur. The mode refers to the most frequently observed value in the data.

In a [normal distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp), the mean, [mode](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mode.asp), and [median](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp) are all the same value and occur at the center of the plot.

## What Other Tools Along With Mean Can Investors Use?

While the mean is a good tool to evaluate performance, it should be used with other [fundamentals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp) and statistical tools to get a better and broader picture of an investment’s historical and future returns.

## Is a Mean the Same As an Average?

Yes. A mean is the mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers.

## The Bottom Line

The mean is another word for a mathematical average. The simple or arithmetic mean is the average calculated by summing up the values of some observations and dividing by the number of observations. The geometric mean is calculated by multiplying all the numbers in a dataset and then taking the nth root of the product, where n is the total number of values in the dataset.
