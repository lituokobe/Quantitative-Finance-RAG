# Cash Dividend vs. Stock Dividend: Key Differences and Examples

## What Is a Cash Dividend?

A cash dividend is a payout made by a company to its shareholders in the form of money, typically drawn from the company's earnings or accumulated profits. Unlike [stock dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockdividend.asp), which issue additional shares, cash dividends put cash directly into the investors' hands, often providing a steady income stream.

For example, Nike has a long history of paying regular cash dividends, a sign of its stability and maturity as a company. Understanding how cash dividends work is key for investors who want to factor dividend payments into their earnings and long-term investment strategies.

### Key Takeaways

- Cash dividends are paid directly to stockholders in cash, often as part of a corporation's earnings or accumulated profits.
- Companies typically distribute cash dividends on a regular schedule, such as quarterly, though there are instances of one-time payouts.
- Cash dividends reduce a company’s shareholders' equity and cash balance, although they don't affect the income statement.
- Dividend-paying companies usually have stable cash flows and are beyond their initial growth phase.
- Investors must report cash dividends as taxable income and typically receive this information on IRS Form 1099-DIV.

## Understanding Cash Dividends: Payment Processes and Policies

Cash dividends are a common way for companies to return [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) to their shareholders in the form of periodic cash payments—typically, quarterly—but some stocks may pay these bonuses on a monthly, annual, or semiannual basis.

Besides regular dividends, some firms pay special cash dividends after events like legal settlements or large one-time distributions. Each company establishes its dividend policy and periodically assesses if a dividend cut or an increase is warranted. Cash dividends are paid on a per-share basis.

## Cash Dividend Timelines: Key Dates and Processes

A company's board announces a cash dividend on a [declaration date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/declarationdate.asp), specifying the amount per common share. After the announcement, a record date is set to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the payment.

Stock exchanges set an [ex-dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp) date, usually two business days before the record date. Investors who buy shares before the ex-dividend date are entitled to the cash dividend.

### Important

Investors must report dividend earnings, and they are taxable as income for the recipients—IRS [Form 1099-DIV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form1099div.asp) will list the total amount of reportable dividend earnings.

## Identifying Dividend-Paying Companies: Characteristics and Policies

Companies that pay dividends typically enjoy stable cash flows, and their businesses are commonly beyond the growth stage. This business growth cycle partially explains why growth firms do not pay dividends—they need these funds to expand their operations, build factories, and increase their personnel.

Certain dividend-paying companies may go as far as establishing dividend payout targets, which are based on generated profits in a given year. For example, banks typically pay out a certain percentage of their profits in the form of cash dividends. If profits decline, the [dividend policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendpolicy.asp) can be amended or postponed to better times.

### Fast Fact

Cash dividends are a common way for companies to return capital to shareholders.

## Financial Accounting for Cash Dividends: Impact and Reporting

When a corporation declares a dividend, it debits its [retained earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp) and credits a liability account called dividend payable. On the date of payment, the company reverses the dividend payable with a debit entry and credits its cash account for the respective cash outflow.

Cash dividends do not affect a company's income statement. However, they [shrink a company's shareholders' equity](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stockholders-equity.asp) and cash balance by the same amount. Firms must report any cash dividend as payments in the financing activity section of their [cash flow statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp).

The easiest way to compare cash dividends across companies is to look at the [trailing 12-month (TTM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp) dividend yields, which are computed as a company's dividends per share for the most recent 12-month period divided by its current stock price. This computation standardizes the measure of cash dividends concerning the price of a common share.

## Cash Dividend Example

Nike is a rather mature firm that pays quarterly cash dividends. In February 2022, the sportswear brand announced a $0.305 per share quarterly cash dividend payable Apr. 1, 2022. For fiscal year 2021, the company saw [year-over-year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/year-over-year.asp) (YOY) increased revenues of 19.3%. Meanwhile, earnings per share (EPS) rose 123%.

## What Is a Stock Dividend?

Less common than cash dividends, [stock dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockdividend.asp) instead pay shareholders with additional shares of stock.

## What Is a Special Dividend?

A [special dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialdividend.asp) is paid to shareholders outside of the regular dividend schedule. It may result from a windfall earnings, spin-off, or other corporate action that is seen as a one-off. In general, special dividends are rare but larger than ordinary dividends.

## What Are Dividend Aristocrats?

A [dividend aristocrat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend-aristocrat.asp)is a stock that increases its dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. Examples include AT&T, ExxonMobil, Caterpillar, 3M, and IBM, among others.

## The Bottom Line

A cash dividend is a payment made to shareholders in cash, usually from a company's current earnings or accumulated profits. These dividends are often distributed on a regular schedule, such as quarterly or monthly, but can also be issued as one-time special dividends. The company's board of directors decides when and how much to pay, setting the declaration and record dates.

While cash dividends provide income to investors, they reduce the company's cash balance and appear in the financing section of the cash flow statement. Unlike stock dividends, which issue additional shares, cash dividends deliver direct payments and are taxable to recipients, who report them using IRS Form 1099-DIV.
