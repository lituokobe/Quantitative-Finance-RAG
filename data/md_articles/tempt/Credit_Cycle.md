# Understanding Credit Cycles: Key Phases, Factors, and Strategic Use in Investing

## What Is a Credit Cycle?

A credit cycle is the pattern of expansion and contraction in the availability of credit within an economy, which moves with broader economic growth and decline. These cycles tend to last longer than business cycles and can have far-reaching effects on borrowing, investment, and financial stability. The 2008 financial crisis, driven by excessive credit expansion and subsequent tightening, is a key example of how powerful these cycles can be. Since then, central bank policies like interest rate adjustments have played an increasingly complex role in shaping credit conditions and managing economic balance.

### Key Takeaways

- Credit cycles involve phases of easy and tight access to borrowing and lending based on economic conditions.
- A credit cycle typically lasts longer than a business cycle because weakened economic fundamentals take time to become evident.
- During expansionary phases, credit is more accessible due to lower interest rates and relaxed lending rules.
- In contraction periods, tighter lending standards and higher interest rates reduce credit availability.
- Understanding the credit cycle can help investors make informed financial decisions.

## How Credit Cycles Impact Borrowing and Lending

Credit cycles first go through periods in which funds are relatively easy to borrow. This expansionary period is characterized by lower interest rates, lowered lending requirements, and an increase in the amount of available credit, which stimulates a general increase in economic activity. These periods are followed by a [contraction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contraction.asp) in the availability of funds.

During the contraction period of the credit cycle, interest rates climb and lending rules become more strict, meaning that less credit is available for business loans, home loans, and other personal loans. The contraction period continues until risks are reduced for the lending institutions, at which point the cycle troughs out and then begins again with renewed credit.

Credit availability is determined by risk and profitability to the lenders. The lower the risk and greater profitability to lenders, the more they are willing to extend loans. During high access to credit in the credit cycle, risk is reduced because investments in real estate and businesses are increasing in value therefore the repayment ability of corporate borrowers should be sound. Individuals are also more willing to take out loans to spend or invest because funds are cheaper and their incomes are stable or on the rise.

### Important

The credit cycle is one of several recurrent economic cycles identified by economists.

When the peak of the [economic cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-cycle.asp) turns, the assets and investments generally begin to decrease in value, or they do not return as much income, reducing the amounts of cash flow to pay back loans. Banks then tighten lending requirements and raise interest rates. This is due to the higher risk of borrower default.

Ultimately, this cuts down the available credit pool and at the same time decreases demand for new loans as borrowers deleverage their balance sheets, bringing the credit cycle back to the low access point. Some economists consider the credit cycle to be an integral part of larger business cycles in the economy.**

### Fast Fact

Knowing where we are in the credit cycle can help investors and businesses make more informed decisions about their investments.

## Factors Extending the Duration of Credit Cycles

The average credit cycle tends to be longer than the [business cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp) in duration because it takes time for a weakening of corporate fundamentals or property values to show up. In other words, there can be an over-extension of credit in terms of amount and period, as spectacularly demonstrated last decade.

### Fast Fact

A contraction in credit is considered to have been a primary cause of the 2008 financial crisis.

Since the financial crisis, the link between the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy and the credit cycle in the U.S. has become more complex. Economic changes have affected inflation rates, which policymakers are still trying to understand. This makes it harder to set interest rate policies, which affect the credit cycle.

## The Bottom Line

The credit cycle is the recurring phases of expansion, when borrowing is easy and credit is widely available, and contraction, when lending becomes more restrictive. Unlike business cycles, credit cycles last longer because the effects of excessive borrowing or weak fundamentals often take time to surface. These cycles help shape economic activity, influencing interest rates, lending standards, and financial stability. For investors, understanding which phase the economy is in can help guide investment and risk management decisions. Credit cycles have driven major economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, indicating how important they are in global markets.
