### Key Takeaways

- A spin-off is an independent company created when a parent company issues shares in an existing business or division to parent company shareholders.
- A parent company may form a spin-off when it projects that a new, independent entity will be worth more than it was as part of the company.

## How a Spin-Off Is Created

A [parent company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parentcompany.asp) will spin off part of its business if it expects it will be lucrative. The spin-off will have a separate management structure and a new name, but retain the same assets, intellectual property, and human resources. The parent company may continue to provide financial and technological support.

A corporation creates a spin-off by distributing 100% of its ownership interest in the targeted business unit as shares of stock to existing shareholders. It can also offer its existing shareholders a discount to [exchange their shares in the parent company](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032415/how-do-spinoffs-impact-investors-both-parent-and-subsidiary-companies.asp) for shares of the spin-off.

## Benefits

- A spin-off may enable the business unit to focus its resources and better manage areas with greater long-term potential.
- Businesses can streamline operations and spin off less productive or unrelated subsidiary businesses.

- Parent company shareholders may not want the shares of the spin-off they received because the spin-off may not fit their investment criteria.
- The spin-off's share price may dip in the short term because of this selling activity, even if the spin-off’s long-term prospects are positive.

## Examples

In 2022, according to data compiled by EY and Goldman Sachs, over thirty corporate separations, or spin-offs, occurred globally across multiple industries, representing 17% of all announced separations since 2012.

## What Does a Spin-Off Mean for Shareholders?

A parent company creates a corporate separation and distributes shares in a division or subsidiary to parent company shareholders to create a wholly separate business entity.

## How Do Spin-Offs Contribute to Corporate Strategy?

Separation within a corporation can force companies to transform by reprioritizing company strategies. For example, one company may focus on growth and another on profit margins.

## What Is the Difference Between a Spin-Off and a Split-Off?

A split-off is similar to a spin-off, where the parent company offers shares to existing shareholders. However, in a split-off, shareholders must choose between holding shares in the parent company or exchanging some or all of their holdings for shares in the new company.

## The Bottom Line

A spin-off, also known as a spinout or starburst creates a new company from an existing company. It's a type of divestiture and is only done if a parent company expects the new company will be worth more independently.
