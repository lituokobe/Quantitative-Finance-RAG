## Understanding How Stock Volume Influences Market Activity

All of the shares of every transaction that takes place between a buyer and seller of a security contributes to the total volume count of that security on that day. A transaction occurs when a buyer and seller agree to exchange shares for cash. Volume accounts for all shares in the transactions. For example, if five transactions occurred in one day, and each transaction involved 100 shares, the trading volume for that day would be 500.

Exchanges track and provide trading volume data, often for free or with a subscription. Trade volumes are estimated and reported up to every hour during the trading day, with final figures coming the next day. Final trading volume figures are reported the following day.
