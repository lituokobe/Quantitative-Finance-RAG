# Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average: Key Insights on the DJIA

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a stock market index that tracks 30 major public companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. As one of the oldest and widely followed indexes, it's a key indicator of the U.S. economy. Investors and analysts use the Dow to gauge market trends and economic confidence. Changes in the index’s composition reflect shifts in the economy, showcasing the evolution of leading industries and corporations.

### Key Takeaways

- The DJIA is a price-weighted index tracking 30 major U.S. blue-chip stocks.
- Created in 1896, the DJIA serves as a proxy for the U.S. economy's health.
- The index's composition changes over time to reflect economic trends and company performance.
- Criticized for representing just 30 large-cap stocks, the DJIA is less comprehensive than the S&P 500.
- Investors can gain exposure to the DJIA through exchange-traded funds like the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF.

## Decoding the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)

The DJIA is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average. The DJIA was designed to serve as a proxy for the health of the broader U.S. economy. Often referred to simply as the Dow, it is one of the most-watched stock market indexes in the world. While the Dow includes a range of companies, all can be described as [blue chip](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp) companies with consistently stable earnings.

In the early 20th century, the performance of industrial companies was typically tied to the overall growth rate in the economy. That cemented the relationship between the Dow's performance and the overall economy. Even today, for many investors, a strong-performing Dow equals a strong economy, while a weak-performing Dow generally means a slowing economy.

The index changes with the economy. Companies that become less relevant are replaced with those that better reflect current trends. For instance, a company may be removed from the index when its [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) drops because of financial distress.

Stocks with higher share prices are given greater weight in the index. So, a higher percentage move in a higher-priced component will have a greater impact on the final calculated value. Initially, Charles Dow used a simple average for the 12 component stocks. However, as mergers and stock splits occurred, this method became ineffective.

| Metric               | Value       |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Current Index Value  | \$46,358.42 |
| Year Formed          | 1896        |
| Total Market Cap.    | \$22.26T    |
| Number of Stocks     | 30          |
| Total Revenues       | \$4.38T     |


## How the Dow Divisor Shapes Index Calculation

The Dow divisor was created to address the simple average issue. The divisor is a predetermined constant that is used to determine the effect of a one-point move in any of the about 30 stocks that comprise the Dow. There have been instances when the divisor needed to be changed so that the value of the Dow stayed consistent. As of 2024, the Dow Divisor was 0.15265312230608.

Unlike the S&P 500, the Dow isn't a weighted average and doesn't represent market cap. Instead, it's the sum of all share prices divided by the divisor, meaning a one-point change in any stock moves the index by the same amount.

$$\text{DJIA Price} = \text{SUM} (\text{Component Stock Prices}) / \text{Dow Divisor}$$

### Important

The S&P 500 has outperformed the DJIA on an annualized basis over the last three-, five-, and 10-year periods.

## Key Components of the DJIA Index

The DJIA launched in 1896 with just 12 companies, primarily in the industrial sector. They included railroads, cotton, gas, sugar, tobacco, and oil. The index grew to 30 components by 1928. Since then, it's changed many times—the very first came three months after the 30-component index launched. The first large-scale change was in 1932 when eight stocks in the Dow were replaced.

The Dow undergoes regular reevaluation, and non-compliant companies are replaced by those meeting the criteria. Over time, the index became a [bellwether](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bellwether.asp) of the U.S. economy, reflecting economic changes. For example, U.S. Steel was removed from the index in 1991 and replaced by building material company Martin Marietta.

## Recent Changes in DJIA Index Components

As the index is reevaluated, major changes to the DJIA can occur over time:

- In 1997, Westinghouse Electric, Bethlehem Steel, Texaco, and Woolworths were replaced by Travelers' Group, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), HP Inc. (HPQ), and Walmart Inc. (WMT).
- In 1999, Chevron Corp. (CVX), Sears Roebuck, Union Carbide, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) were dropped, while Home Depot Inc. (HD), Intel Corporation (INTC), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and SBC Communications were added in their place.
- Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) replaced General Electric (later split into different companies) in June 2018.
- In August 2020, Salesforce (CRM), Amgen Inc. (AMGN), and Honeywell International (HON) were added to the Dow, replacing ExxonMobil (XOM), Pfizer Inc. (PFE), and defense and aerospace contractor Raytheon Technologies (RTN). Raytheon had joined the DJIA earlier that year after United Technologies (UTX) merged with Raytheon.
- In 2024, several additional changes were made to the index composition. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) replaced Walgreens in February 2024 after Walmart's stock split, which reduced its weight on the index. In November 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) was added, replacing Intel. This change reflected NVIDIA's remarkable growth in the semiconductor sector, particularly driven by its advances in artificial intelligence technology. Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also joined the index, replacing Dow Inc. (DOW). Sherwin-Williams is well-known for its extensive range of paint and coatings and has shown strong performance in the market, significantly outperforming Dow, which has struggled since its split from DowDuPont.

These latest changes mark just the 53rd adjustment to the DJIA since its inception in 1896 and highlight a shift toward companies that are more relevant in their respective industries.

## Major Milestones in DJIA History

The following are some important historical milestones achieved by the Dow:

- March 15, 1933: The largest one-day percentage gain in the index happened during the 1930s bear market, totaling 15.34%. The Dow gained 8.26 points and closed at 62.10.

### Tip

Individuals can invest in the Dow, which would mean gaining exposure to all of the companies listed in it, through exchange-traded funds ([ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)), such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF ([DIA](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=dia)).

## Identifying the Limits of the DJIA

Critics say the Dow doesn't fully represent the U.S. economy because it includes only 30 large-cap companies, ignoring smaller ones. They believe the S&P 500, with more companies, offers a better reflection of the economy.

Critics also believe that factoring only the price of a stock in the calculation does not accurately reflect a company, as much as considering a company's market cap would. In this manner, a company with a higher stock price but a smaller market cap would have more weight than a company with a smaller stock price but a larger market cap, which would poorly reflect the true size of a company.

The Dow is also a [price-weighted index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/priceweightedindex.asp) instead of being weighted by market capitalization. This means that stocks in the index with higher share prices have greater influence, even if they are smaller companies overall in terms of market value. In a price-weighted index, a stock that increases from \$110 to \$120 will have the same net effect on the index as a stock that increases from \$10 to \$20, even though the percentage move for the latter is far greater than that of the higher-priced stock. This also means that stock splits can impact the index, while they would not for a [market cap-weighted index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp).

## What Does the Dow Jones Industrial Average Measure?

The DJIA [tracks the price movements](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050115/what-does-dow-jones-industrial-average-measure.asp) of 30 large companies in the U.S.. Such companies include Microsoft and Home Depot. The selected companies are from all major U.S. sectors, except utilities and transportation.

## When Did the DJIA Top 10,000 for the First Time?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 10,000 for the first time in March 1999. The DJIA then hit 11,750 in January 2000, before falling to below 7,200 in October 2002 after the dot-com crash.

## The DJIA Is Based on the Prices of How Many Stocks?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is made up of 30 large stocks. All the stocks are based in the United States. The DJIA is also known as the Dow 30.

## How Does the Dow Differ from the S&P 500?

The S&P 500 and DJIA are the two most-watched stock indexes in the U.S. However, these two benchmarks are very different:

- The Dow Jones Industrial Index tracks 30 large-cap stocks, while the S&P 500 tracks the largest 500 stocks in the U.S. market.
- The Dow Jones index is price-weighted, while the S&P 500 is market-cap-weighted.
- A committee chooses the stocks in the Dow. The stocks in the S&P 500 are added according to a formula.
- The Dow Jones uses a divisor; the S&P 500 is expressed versus a base year.

## The Bottom Line

The DJIA is a widely followed stock market index, tracking 30 major publicly owned U.S. blue-chip companies. It is also an indicator of the U.S. economy. Because the index is price-weighted, stocks with higher share prices have a greater impact on its movements, which is important for investors to understand when interpreting performance. Its composition has changed to reflect shifts in the economy and the relevance of leading companies, making it an evolving measure of market trends. It has a narrow focus on large-cap firms and lacks representation of smaller companies and certain sectors. The Dow Divisor helps maintain its consistency by adjusting for stock splits and other structural changes.
