# Nasdaq Explained: History, Trading System, and Financial Insights

## What Is the Nasdaq?

Nasdaq is a pioneering global electronic marketplace that revolutionized the buying and selling of securities. Originally an acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, Nasdaq was established by the National Association of Securities Dealers (now known as FINRA) in 1971, ushering in the world's first automated stock exchange.

The platform not only made trading faster and more transparent but also set the stage for subsequent technological advances in the financial markets. Today, Nasdaq is home to more than 5,000 companies, many of which are major technology players like Apple and Microsoft. As it grew in prominence, the exchange evolved into its three-tiered structure—the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq Global Market, and the Nasdaq Capital Market—and became a key indicator of the tech sector's economic impact and the broader financial market's health.

## Deep Dive Into the Nasdaq: How It Operates

As noted above, the Nasdaq is a stock exchange headquartered in New York. It began as a subsidiary of the NASD and officially opened for business on Feb. 8, 1971. It was the world's first automated stock exchange.

Nasdaq became a national securities exchange separate from NASD in 2006. In 2008, it merged with the Scandinavian exchanges group OMX, forming Nasdaq OMX Group. The company changed its name to Nasdaq Inc. in 2015.

There are more than 5,000 companies that are listed and traded on the exchange on a daily basis. Many of these companies are major technology companies, such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Since 2006, the Nasdaq has consisted of three tiers: the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq Global Market, and the Nasdaq Capital Market.

The exchange runs 29 markets for trading stocks, derivatives, fixed income, and commodities across the U.S., Canada, Scandinavia, and the Baltics. The company also runs a clearinghouse and five central securities depositories in the United States and Europe. Its trading technology is employed by 100 exchanges across 50 countries.

## Exploring the Nasdaq Composite Index

The term Nasdaq is also used to refer to the Nasdaq Composite. This is an index of more than 2,500 stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange. This index includes some of the major technology giants, such as:

- Apple (AAPL)
- Microsoft (MSFT)
- Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
- Meta Platforms (META)
- Amazon (AMZN)
- Tesla (TSLA)

The Nasdaq Composite closed at a record high of 16,057.44 on Nov. 19, 2021. The index proceeded to drop more than 23% from that point through April 2022. The Nasdaq Composite's 13.3% drop in April 2022 was its steepest monthly decline since losing 17.4% in October 2008 during the global financial crisis. It closed at 13,787.92 on June 30, 2023.

Nasdaq Inc., trading under the symbol NDAQ, has been in the S&P 500 Index since 2008.

## The Evolution and Impact of Nasdaq's Trading System

The Nasdaq computerized trading system was initially devised as an alternative to the inefficient specialist system, which was the prevalent model for almost a century. The rapid evolution of technology has made Nasdaq’s electronic trading model the standard for markets worldwide.

It made sense for emerging tech companies to list on an exchange using the latest technology. As the tech sector boomed in the 1980s and 1990s, the Nasdaq Composite Index became its most quoted benchmark.

That turned Nasdaq Composite into the index of the dot-com boom and bust. After rallying nearly 150% in the 16 months through March 2000, the Nasdaq Composite then slumped almost 80% by October 2002.

## A Chronicle of Nasdaq’s Growth and Milestones

In November 2016, chief operating officer (COO) Adena Friedman was promoted to the role of chief executive officer (CEO), becoming the first woman to run a major exchange in the United States.

### Pioneering Diversity: Nasdaq’s Board Disclosure Rule

On Dec. 1, 2020, Nasdaq proposed a new rule requiring companies listed on the exchange to report on the diversity of their board of directors. The rule mandates companies to have at least one female director and one member from an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+ on their boards, or to explain publicly why they don't. The SEC approved the board diversity disclosure rule on Aug. 6, 2021.

### Analyzing Nasdaq’s Financial Health and Revenue Streams

Nasdaq generates revenue from clients, including financial institutions, brokers, institutional investors, and corporations. Nasdaq's revenue is mainly derived from fees charged for the following:

- Market technology, which includes trading and settlement platforms as well as technology safeguards against financial crime
- Corporate services, such as listing fees and investment relations services
