# Coupon Bonds Explained: Definition, Function, and Modern Use

### Key Takeaways

- Coupon bonds are debt obligations that provide semiannual interest payments, often sold anonymously without record of purchase.
- While once common, coupon bonds are now rare due to the prevalence of electronic payments and registered bonds.
- Investors receive interest payments by presenting coupons attached to the bond, making it a simple way to collect earned interest.
- Higher coupon rates on bonds make them more attractive to investors since they offer higher yields.
- Unregistered coupon bonds, or bearer bonds, may facilitate tax evasion and other fraudulent activities.

## What Is a Coupon Bond?

A coupon bond is a bond with coupons attached that are used by the bondholder to collect twice-a-year interest payments until the bond matures. Coupon bonds are increasingly rare since the advent of electronic payments. However coupon bonds—also called bearer bonds—offer a simple way for an investor to collect on earned interest.

## Understanding the Mechanics of Coupon Bonds

Coupon bonds are rare today because most bonds are electronic, though some prefer paper certificates. Now, "coupon bond" mainly refers to the interest rate they offer, not their physical form.

Bonds typically have \$25 semi-annual payments. Coupons describe this rate, known as the coupon rate, which can vary. Higher rates attract investors due to higher yields. Calculate the coupon rate by dividing the yearly coupon total by the bond's face value.

## Practical Application and Example of Coupon Bonds

If an investor purchases a \$1,000 ABC Company coupon bond and the coupon rate is 5%, the issuer provides the investor with a 5% interest every year. This means the investor gets \$50, the face value of the bond derived from multiplying \$1,000 by 0.05, every year.

To claim interest, the investor presents the proper coupon from the bond certificate to the issuer's agent.

## Key Considerations for Investing in Unregistered Bonds

Coupon bonds are usually bearer bonds. Anyone who submits the required coupons to the issuer gets the interest, even if they're not the bond’s owner. This allows for potential tax evasion and fraud.

Modern bonds are typically registered bonds with physical certificates that provide the terms of the debt and the name of the registered holder who receives interest payments automatically from the issuing institution. Some bonds are in the form of book-entry bonds, which are electronically registered and linked to the issuer and its investors. In book-entry bonds, the investor gets receipts instead of certificates. Investors also get accounts handled by financial institutions. They are able to receive their interest payments through these accounts.

## The Bottom Line

Coupon bonds are debt obligations with attached interest payment coupons, making them unique compared to modern electronically registered bonds. Coupon bonds are considered bearer bonds, allowing for anonymity but also posing risks like tax evasion. To collect their interest payments, bondholders simply detach the coupons and present them for cash to the issuer or more likely, the issuer's agent (e.g., a bank). Bonds with higher coupon rates are attractive due to their higher yields but must be understood in the context of overall bond valuation. The shift away from paper certificates and actual coupons to electronic registration has provided more investment security and efficiency.
