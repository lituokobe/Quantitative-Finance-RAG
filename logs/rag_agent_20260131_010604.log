What is put option?

**Optimized Version for Answer-Retrieval in a Vector Database:**  
Definition of a put option in financial markets.

**Explanation:**  
The original question is a simple definition request. To optimize it for retrieval in a vector database, we rephrase it to be more specific and aligned with how such information is typically stored and queried. Using "definition" and specifying the context ("financial markets") helps the system identify relevant documents or embeddings that contain the precise meaning of a put option.": <MilvusException: (code=1, message=Unexpected error, message=<required argument is not a float>)>
