2026-01-31 01:25:50,454 - DocumentGraderNode - INFO: Retrieved document What Is the Black-Scholes Model?

The Black-Scholes model, also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, is one of the most important concepts in modern financial theory. It helps [traders and investors](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-brokers-4587872) determine the fair value of an options contract.

This mathematical equation estimates the theoretical value of derivatives based on other investment instruments. It considers the impact of time and other risk factors in its calculation.

It was developed in 1973 and is still regarded as one of the best ways to price an options contract. is relevant

2026-01-31 01:25:51,844 - DocumentGraderNode - INFO: Retrieved document What Are the Limitations of the Black-Scholes Model?

The Black-Scholes model is only used to price European options. It doesn't take into account that American options could be exercised before the expiration date. The model also assumes that dividends, volatility, and risk-free rates remain constant over the option's life. Not taking taxes, commissions, or trading costs into account can also lead to valuations that deviate from real-world results. is NOT relevant, dump it.

2026-01-31 01:25:52,259 - DocumentGraderNode - INFO: Retrieved document Key Takeaways

- The Black-Scholes model is also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton or BSM model.
- It's a differential equation that's widely used to price options contracts.
- The Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility.
- The Black-Scholes model is usually accurate, but it makes certain assumptions that can lead to predictions that deviate from real-world results.
- The standard BSM model is only used to price European options because it doesn't take into account that American options could be exercised before the expiration date. is relevant
